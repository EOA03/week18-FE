# FRONTEND

## PROJECT DETAILS

I made the frontend of the todo list. I just want to info that not all of the frontend that connect to the database.
There are make a new todo list, list of the todo list, edit the todo list and delete the todo list.
There also have some issue, the admin-dashboard that not appear after you login using admin account.
I'm sorry for the problems, I run out off time to fix it, but I'll fix it later.
